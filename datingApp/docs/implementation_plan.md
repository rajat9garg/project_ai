- Always create a different file for different Tasks

## CREATE Implementation Plan
    1. Task1
    Objective:- 
        Build a **simple and scalable user registration flow** that collects user details and dating preferences, without passwords or authentication.

    ### Key Notes
    - Do **not** implement login, authentication, or password handling.
    - Do **not** add any security/encryption for now â€” this is a functional prototype.
    - Ensure that the system can support **matchmaking preferences** later.

    ### Functional Requirements
        - Allow new users to register with:
        - Name
        - Age
        - Gender
        - Location
        - Preferences (e.g., gender they're interested in, age range, etc.)
        - Store data in a scalable and queryable way (suggest DB schema if applicable).
        - Design RESTful or GraphQL APIs if needed.
        - Optional: seed dummy data for testing.

    ### Deliverables
        - Architecture overview of this module
        - Component and service-level breakdown
        - Models/entities and database schema
        - API contracts (if applicable)
        - Example input/output data
        - Task written to `tasks/user-registration.md`

    ### Test Case
        - Write Unit Test cases
