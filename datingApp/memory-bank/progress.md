## Key Decisions

Key architectural decisions have been documented in the [Decision Log](./decision-log.md). Recent decisions include:

1. [Authentication Mechanism](./decision-log.md#2025-05-18---authentication-mechanism)
2. [Database Selection](./decision-log.md#2025-05-18---database-selection)
3. [Frontend Framework](./decision-log.md#2025-05-18---frontend-framework)

For details on the rationale and alternatives considered, please refer to the [Decision Log](./decision-log.md).

## Current Blockers
1. **Pending Architecture Review** - Need to finalize the authentication flow
2. **Open Questions** - Several key decisions pending (see [Open Questions](./open-questions.md))
3. **Infrastructure Setup** - Need to set up CI/CD pipeline
4. **Test Coverage** - Need to improve test coverage for edge cases

## Upcoming Tasks
1. [ ] Finalize authentication flow (Blocked by: Architecture Review)
2. [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. [ ] Implement user authentication
4. [ ] Add more test coverage for edge cases
5. [ ] Implement user profile management
6. [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
7. [ ] Address open questions (see [Open Questions](./open-questions.md))

- [ ] Document API specifications (Due: 2025-05-21) - @tech-writer

## Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: N/A (not yet measured)
- **Open Issues**: 5 (see [Open Questions](./open-questions.md))
- **Closed Issues**: 0
- **Test Status**: Not started
- **Documentation Coverage**: 70% (in progress)
- **Critical Decisions Made**: 3 (see [Decision Log](./decision-log.md))

## Retrospective
### What Went Well
- Quick project setup
- Clear initial requirements
- Good team alignment on technology choices
- Documentation structure established early

### What Could Be Improved
- Need to define more detailed user stories
- Should set up CI/CD earlier in the process
- Need better tracking of open questions and decisions

### Action Items for Next Sprint
1. Set up testing framework
2. Define API contracts
3. Create initial database migrations
4. Review and address open questions
5. Finalize authentication flow
