## 2025-05-18 - Authentication Mechanism
- **Status**: Approved
- **Context**: Need secure user authentication for the dating app
- **Decision**: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication
- **Consequences**: 
  - Stateless server architecture
  - Need token refresh mechanism
  - Simpler horizontal scaling
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Session-based auth: Requires server-side session storage
  - OAuth 2.0: More complex, but could be added later for social logins
- **Related**: [Auth Service](./system-patterns.md#authentication-service)

## 2025-05-18 - Database Selection
- **Status**: Approved
- **Context**: Need a flexible, scalable database for user profiles and matches
- **Decision**: Use MongoDB as the primary database
- **Consequences**:
  - Flexible schema for evolving user profiles
  - Native geospatial queries for location-based matching
  - Eventual consistency model
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - PostgreSQL: More rigid schema, better for transactions
  - Cassandra: Better for write-heavy workloads but more complex
- **Related**: [Database Schema](./system-patterns.md#database-schema)

## 2025-05-18 - Frontend Framework
- **Status**: Approved
- **Context**: Need a cross-platform mobile and web solution
- **Decision**: Use React Native for mobile and React for web
- **Consequences**:
  - Code sharing between web and mobile
  - Large community and ecosystem
  - Need to handle platform-specific code
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Flutter: Good for mobile, but newer ecosystem
  - Native development: Better performance but higher maintenance
- **Related**: [Frontend Architecture](./tech-context.md#frontend-architecture)
