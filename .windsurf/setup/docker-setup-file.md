STEP 1: CREATE DOCKER-COMPOSE FILE

Before beginning please ask project name which I want to generate the compose file 
and then take a look at all the technologies that are needed and then add them to docker compose file

Generate the file inside the project folder

1. Create a new file named docker-compose.yml in the root directory of your project.

2. Begin the file with the version specification for docker-compose. Use the latest stable version, such as '3.8'.

3. Define a services section in the YAML file.

4. Add a service for your Spring Boot application:
    - Name the service (e.g., 'app').
    - Specify the build context (usually '.').
    - Map the container's port to a host port.
    - List dependencies on other services.

5. For each technology used in your project, add a corresponding service:

   For PostgreSQL:
    - Name the service (e.g., 'db').
    - Specify the PostgreSQL image and version.
    - Set environment variables for database name, user, and password.
    - Map the container's port to a host port.
    - Define a volume for data persistence.

   For MySQL:
    - Follow similar steps as PostgreSQL, but use the MySQL image.

   For MongoDB:
    - Name the service (e.g., 'mongodb').
    - Specify the MongoDB image and version.
    - Set environment variables if needed.
    - Map the container's port to a host port.
    - Define a volume for data persistence.

   For Redis:
    - Name the service (e.g., 'redis').
    - Specify the Redis image and version.
    - Map the container's port to a host port.
    - Optionally, add a command to enable persistence.

   For Elasticsearch:
    - Name the service (e.g., 'elasticsearch').
    - Specify the Elasticsearch image and version.
    - Set environment variables for cluster name, discovery type, etc.
    - Map multiple ports (HTTP and transport).
    - Define volumes for data and configuration.

   For Kafka:
    - Add services for both Kafka and ZooKeeper.
    - For ZooKeeper, specify image and map ports.
    - For Kafka, specify image, set environment variables, map ports, and define volumes.

   For RabbitMQ:
    - Name the service (e.g., 'rabbitmq').
    - Specify the RabbitMQ image and version.
    - Map ports for AMQP and management interface.
    - Optionally, set environment variables for default user and password.

6. If using volumes, define a volumes section at the end of the file.

7. Ensure all services that your application depends on are listed in the 'depends_on' section of your application service.

8. Review the file for correct YAML syntax and indentation.

9. Save the docker-compose.yml file.

After creating the docker-compose.yml file, you can start all services with the command 'docker-compose up' or 'docker-compose up -d' for detached mode.
