---

## Version Control Rules

1. All `memory-bank` files must be version controlled.
2. Commit messages should specify updated file(s) and purpose.
3. Use semantic versioning for major documentation milestones (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
4. Create Git tags for key project stages (e.g., `alpha`, `beta`, `MVP-release`).
5. Follow branching conventions for docs (e.g., `docs/update-patterns`).

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. Review all files at the **start of each sprint or iteration**.
2. Keep cross-references between files consistent and updated.
3. Archive older sections when making significant rewrites.
4. Ensure documentation is always **in sync with code and PRs**.
5. Validate all links and diagrams periodically.

---

## Backup Strategy

1. Take automated daily backups of the `memory-bank/` directory.
2. Retain backups for a rolling window of **30 days**.
3. Store backups in a secure off-site or cloud location.
4. Perform quarterly validation of the backup restoration process.

---

## Review Process

1. Include `memory-bank/` updates in **Definition of Done**.
2. Ensure memory-bank entries are reviewed in PR reviews.
3. Perform a **monthly health check** of documentation.
4. Update documentation as part of issue/PR closure workflow.

---

## Best Practices

1. Keep content **clear, concise, and well-structured**.
2. Use **consistent markdown formatting and section headers**.
3. Add diagrams or visuals for architecture and flows.
4. Document **not just what was done, but why it was done**.
5. Maintain a changelog or footer timestamp for each file.
6. Use templates where applicable (decision logs, personas, etc.).
7. Include examples and references for future team members.

---

## Compliance

1. Ensure documentation follows team and org-level standards.
2. Mask or exclude sensitive data in all files.
3. Maintain a log of **who updated what and when** (via Git history).
4. Define access controls for confidential files.
5. Capture approvals for critical or externally-facing documentation.
